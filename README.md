# To-do-List Application

The To-do-List Application is a simple Java Swing GUI-based program developed in NetBeans. This application allows users to create, view, and delete notes. Users can input a title and description for each note, and the application records the date and time of each entry. The notes are displayed in a table format, providing an organized view of all entries. The "Add Note" button adds new notes to the table, while the "Delete" button removes selected notes. The application provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for managing personal notes effectively.
